1 HDFS Federation :

Hdfs Federation was designed to limit failures.
In hadoop 1.x ,namenode acts as a single point of failure.(If it goes down,Entire system fails); 
HDFS Federation avoids this by maintaining multiple namenodes.
Those namenodes are independent of each other.
They donot require coordination among themselves.
Eventhough one namenode fails the namespace volume managed by other name nodes are alive.

Advantages:
Multiple namenodes are in an active-standby mode.
If the active namnode fails the standby name nodes becomes active.
Both namenodes share the edit logs.




2.How HDFS handles failures while writing data?

Data read/write are performed using a pipelined architecture.
Packets in the ack queue are added to the front of data queue.
Current block in good datanodes is given a new identity and it is informed to
the namenode.
The datanode that is failed is removed from the pipeline and a new pipeline is constructed from
the 2 good datanodes and remaining of the blockâ€™s data is written to the good datanodes in the pipeline.
The namenode arranges for further replica of the block to be created on another node.
If minimum replicas (1) are written, the write will succeed and the block is replicated 
across the cluster until the target replication factor 3 is reached.
